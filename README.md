# nvd-mirror

A simple shell script to mirror the CPE/CVE XML data from NIST.

The purpose of nvd-mirror is to be able to replicate the NIST vulnerabiity 
data inside a company firewall so that local (faster) access to NIST data 
can be achieved.

Is you need a version that works on windows, please [check this project](https://github.com/stevespringett/nist-data-mirror).
